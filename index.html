                    Thesis : <u>Design and Development of Textrode based ECG Monitoring System </u> 
                    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uV_ZUyrFspj4Aaj0xTMyCnUEh8GM11gW/view">[paper]</a>
                    <br />
                    Built wearable technology using dry textile electrodes for round-the-clock monitoring and logging of electrocardiogram signals. Heart
                    signals of 0.5mV were collected using a chest strap with textrode patches. The signals were amplified and filtered by designing specialized
                    instrumentation amplifiers and notch filters to extract the QRS complex. The research project was funded by the <a href="http://www.cmet.gov.in/">Center for Materials for
                    Electronics Technology (Govt. of India)</a> and is to be filed for a patent.
